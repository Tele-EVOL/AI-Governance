## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource hub for **AI Governance**. The rapid advancement of AI has introduced complex technical vulnerabilities and societal risks, underscoring the pressing need for a holistic governance framework. This collection aims to bridge the gap between technical research, policy-making, and real-world application by curating not only academic papers but also key **policies and regulations**, impactful **news and case studies**, practical **technical tools**, and crucial **datasets**.

Our organizing principle is derived from the framework in our survey, "[Never Compromise to Vulnerabilities: A Comprehensive Survey on Al Governance](https://example.com/link_to_your_paper.pdf)," which categorizes AI Governance into three pillars:
* **Intrinsic Security**: Internal system reliability and robustness.
* **Derivative Security**: External, real-world harms from AI deployment.
* **Social Ethics**: Value alignment, accountability, and societal impact.

This repository aims to provide researchers, engineers, policymakers, and the public with a structured guide to navigating the multifaceted landscape of AI Governance.
